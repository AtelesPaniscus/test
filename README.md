Here is a very simple (2D truth table) representation of the Boolean AND operation:

AND   | 0   |  1  |
---:  | --- | --- |
**0** |  0  |  0  |
**1** |  0  |  1  |

Pick a value from the first column (say A) and a value from the top row (say B).  The interection of the chosen row and column contains the result of A AND B.

It is should be easy enough to draw a similar table to represent Boolean OR (don't try this in Slack).

If you think about it a minute, the results part of the table has four cells, each of which may contain one of only two values.  That means there are eight distinct tables representing eight different Boolean operations.  AND, OR and XOR are only three.  What are the other five ?
